## Features

- Command-Line Interface (CLI): Allows users to interact with the database through various prompts and commands.
- Inquirer Integration: Uses the Inquirer package (version 8.2.4) to handle user input and navigate through the application options.
- Database Management: Connect to and manage the employee database using PostgreSQL.
- Persistent Data Storage: Uses PostgreSQL to store all data persistently, ensuring data integrity and availability.


## Installation

- Clone the repo to your device using `git clone` followed by the repo link.

- Ensure you have Node.js and PostgresSQL installed on your machine. 

- Install the dependencies by running the `npm i` command in your terminal.

- Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your PostgresSQL connection details:
`DB_NAME='your_database_name'`
`DB_USER='your_postgresql_username'`
`DB_PASSWORD='your_postgresql_password'`
`DB_HOST='localhost'`
`DB_PORT=3001`

- Set Up the database by logging into postgres on the terminal and running `\i db/schema.sql;`. (If you wish to see example data, run the `node db/seeds.sql` command.) 

- Exit out of postgres and start the application by using `node index.js`.

- Once the server is running, you can use the command-line interface to interact with the employee tracker and perform various operations such as viewing departments, roles, employees, adding new departments, roles, employees, and updating employee roles.



## Usage
